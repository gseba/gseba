# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Ghassan Seba!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m a Data Scientist and Program Manager with 2 decades of experience in workforce development, program management, and data analytics. I have obtained my **Masterâ€™s in Applied Data Science** at the University of San Diego, where I specialized in **machine learning, natural language processing, and data visualization**.

Iâ€™m passionate about transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights using data pipelines, ETL processes, advanced analytics, and machine learning. My mission is to develop data-driven solutions that enhance operational efficiency, uncover hidden patterns, and support strategic decision-making through predictive modeling and intelligent automation.
